	<p>This famous historic place is situated on the northeast side of Dhaka, Bangladesh. This was built during the Mughal rule, on seventeenth century.</p>
	<p>Lalbagh fort is believed to be an incomplete Mughal fort structure which was started in 1678 AD by the Mughal Subahdar Muhammad Azam Shah. 
	As the structure applies to the fine architectural work of that period, 
	it has four main structures which are a Diwan-i-Aam, a water tank in its eastern side, the tomb of Bibi Pari and the Lalbagh Fort Mosque. 
	During the nineteenth century, this fort grew up to be a place of revolution by the local soldiers, against the colonial British rule.</p>

	<p>This is the heritage building of the then jamindar of Jamalpur. It was built during the late eighteenth century by Sheik Enayet Ullah.</p>
	<p>It was built on a huge area covering a summer house for Sheik Enayet Ullah. 
	The son of Sheik Enayet Ullah sold this marvellous property to the French traders. 
	The French got defeated and the English took power of all the properties, once reigned by the French.
	The old French building was then reconstructed to two stories building by Ahsanullah, keeping similarity to the ‘Rangmahal’.
